# The Foresaken Deep
Buried far below the world of light, the dungeon festers in eternal gloom, its corridors slick with age and despair. Whispers slither through the dark like dying breaths, carrying the memory of those who never escaped. In the stillness, something stirs—watching, waiting, starving for the sound of life.

## Player Classes
When a game is first started, the player can choose one of three player types/classes. Each have their own abilities that can be either be used to avoid or protect when encountering enemies.
#### Bulwark The Guardian
`"When the storm hits, Bulwark stands unbroken"`

**Energy Shield** - Prevents loss of points when Gate *OR* Warden is incorrect
#### Aegis The Ravager
`"Breaker of oaths, bearer of darkness"`

**Vengeance Protocol** - starts with 3 Cue Cards *OR* 1 Supreme Cue Card
#### Ronan The Trickster
`"Illusion is the truth you can't handle"`

**Shadow Shift** - skip over 3 gates *OR* 1 Warden without unlocking them

## Enemies
There are two classes of enemies: Gates and Wardens. Gates are much more common and are much lower risk. There are two ways for a player to get past an enemy. They can unlock it or skip it. Unlocking grants points and removes the enemy from the map. Skipping it only allows passage one-way and the enemy will still be there should the player need to turn back. No points are gained from skipping enemies but skipping is good for quick traversal and low risk.
